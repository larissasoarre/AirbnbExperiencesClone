Depending on your (beer) preferences we'll customize the program mid-tour and create an individual, informative and light & easy trip away from the stereotype tourist spots. To get things started and prevent dying from thirst I'll bring the first beer.",

        description: "Meet me for a world history walk in Munich and dive into a past of war and peace. We will stand, where the celebrations of the breakout of World War I - the 'great seminal catastrophe' of the 20th century - took place and where Hitler's Beer Hall Putsch ended in gunfire. We will learn, why the Nazis called Munich 'the capital of the movement' and why the era between 1914-1945 is rightly considered the 2nd Thirty Years War. We will talk about Napoleon and his huge impact on German identity and unification and learn, how these disastrous wars of the past defined our new today and times of peace.",
